## Greetings! 

I am a machine learning researcher, broadly interested in solving the most impactful challenges in machine learning, computer vision, genetics, healthcare and longevity! 

I am currently completing a Computer Science Specialist and Molecular Genetics Major at the University of Toronto (Trinity College), and have contributed to projects at the Vector Institute, AWS, and the University Health Network.
