## Greetings!

I am a Computer Science Specialist and Molecular Genetics Major at the University of Toronto.

This summer, I will be joining **Amazon** as a Software Developer Intern for AWS in Vancouver.

In the Fall, I will be taking a semester off to pursue research at the **Vector Institute**, working with Professor [Michael Brudno](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/michael-brudno) on more machine learning for healthcare!

### Affiliations
- **KITE (University Health Network)** and **Vector Institute**:  
  Working with Professor [Babak Taati](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/babak-taati/) on improving video human 2D pose detection and video human mesh recovery using Infini-Attention and VideoMamba, supported by NSERC.
  
- **MiDATA (University of Toronto)**:  
  Working with Professor [Pascal N. Tyrrell](https://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca/) on latent diffusion models to improve polyp segmentation.

- **International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM)**:  
  As part of the Toronto Team, I fine-tuned Evo (a Striped-Hyena genome model) to generate plasmid sequences with antibacterial resistance for [plasmid.ai](https://github.com/igem-toronto/plasmidai), under the guidance of Professor [Michael J. Garton](http://www.gartonlab.org/index.php).

- **Département d'informatique et de recherche opérationelle (DIRO) (Université de Montréal)**:  
  Represented Team Canada as 1 of 12 teams at the **International Science and Engineering Fair** with a computer vision project, developed in collaboration with Professor [Houari Sahraoui](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/index_eng.html).

In my free time, I am a **bookworm** who loves to eat **pho** and explore niche cafes to study while sipping on **chai latte**!
