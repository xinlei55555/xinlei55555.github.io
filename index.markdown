## Greetings!

I am a machine learning researcher, broadly interested in solving the most impactful challenges in machine learning, computer vision, genetics, healthcare and longevity! 

Academically, I am pursuing a **Computer Science Specialist** and **Molecular Genetics Major** at the **University of Toronto (Trinity College)**.  

### Current & Upcoming Affiliations

- **Vector Institute**:  
  Working as a Machine Learning Research Intern generating facial structures from genetic markers using Latent Diffusion Models.
  *Advisor: [Michael Brudno](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/michael-brudno/)*

- **Amazon Web Services**:  
  Completed a Software Development Engineer Internship where I optimized parallel export to S3 with EMR, Hadoop Spark, and EKS, saving ~$8M/year.
  *Team:  AWS RDS Export to S3*

- **MiDATA (University of Toronto)**:  
  Machine Learning Researcher developing **MedSegGen**, a mask-conditioned Latent Diffusion pipeline for low-label medical segmentation datasets. 
  *❗MedSegGen was accepted at the RSNA Radiology Conference 2025 in Chicago❗*  
  *Advisor: [Pascal N. Tyrrell](https://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca/)*

- **KITE (University Health Network)**:  
  Machine Learning Research Intern building **InfiniPose**, an autoregressive video pose detection model enabling infinite-length predictions.  
  *Advisor: [Babak Taati](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/babak-taati/)*


### Past Affiliations

- **Kadist / Artnow International**:  
  Working as a Machine Learning Engineer (Aug 2024 – Apr 2025, Remote) developing **RsonArt**, a history-aware artist agent with RAG; scraped 300k artists into a pgvector DB.

- **Département d'informatique et de recherche opérationelle (DIRO) (Université de Montréal)**:  
  Machine Learning Researcher (Oct 2022 – Sep 2023). Represented Canada as 1 of 12 teams at the **International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF 2023)** in Dallas, winning 10 awards worth $15k+ for ASL→English translation models.
